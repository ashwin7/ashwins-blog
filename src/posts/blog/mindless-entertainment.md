There is nothing wrong in mindless entertainment. 

I recently watched Pathaan just to see what made it earn INR 50cr on day one of opening. 
It is a mindless action movie in YRF Spyverse (Tiger series, War and now Pathaan). To my surprise I didn't hate the movie.
 
Research has shown that consuming certain types of "mindless" entertainment can have some benefits. For example, watching such movies can reduce stress and improve mood, which can have positive effects on overall well-being. Pathaan at least succeeded in that endeavour. 

I'd give it a 6/10.
