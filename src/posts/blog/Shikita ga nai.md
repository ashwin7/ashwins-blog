There's this Japanese concept called 'Shikita ga nai' ( 仕方がない ) which basically means, "nothing can be done about it".

It is letting go of what we can not change. It's a way of embracing reality and moving on, rather than dwelling on the negatives.

We need to recognize that some things are out of our control, and that's okay. We must let go of what we can not change and focus on what we can influence.
