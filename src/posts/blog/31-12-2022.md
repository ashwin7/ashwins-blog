Obligatory 2022 in Review: 

### The Good
 Got Promoted.
 Completed the goal of reading at least 12 books in 2022.
 Reached our money savings goal.
 Didn't miss any of our planned vacations.
 Got together with team on multiple outings after 2020-2021 lockdown.
 Helped 2 people in getting a job.
 Donated 50% of what I earned from stock market.
 Learned to meditate and Controlled my migraines up to a great extent.

### The Bad
 Wife lost her grandmother. 
 My best friend and groomsman lost his father to cancer.
 Kid was unwell most of the year and then spent a week in hospital due to stomach infection and febrile seizures. Took him months to properly recover.
 Failed to complete a major learning initiative I started.
 

Here's hoping 2023 will bring new opportunities and new milestones.
