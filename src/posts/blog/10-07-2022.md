This is a general feeling these days. 
What to do to reach where I want to be? 
But asking myself where I want to be, I don't even have an answer for that. 
Some days I want to be rich, some days I want to be famous, sometimes I just want to be content. I know I am not alone who feels this way. Reddit is filled with blokes who feel same way. 
It is even difficult to put feelings into words sometimes for this blog.

3 things I am sure that I do want:

1. Keep my family safe and financially secure.
2. Not have to worry about next paycheck. 
3. People to know me. Know that I exist.

Life is not easy to figure out. I thought it'd be when I was young, but it gets more complicated as you age.

Sigh!


Also this is first entry I am writing via mobile using github editor. So yay!
