This is probably  the first and last post I'm writing as I am high. Why? I don't know. Probably because I am alone at home tight now.
Since childhood, I've always believed myself to be special. Bettyer than everyone else. Sometimes because I can code better, sometimes because I feel I stand on a morally high ground. In reality I don't. My decisions in life have usually turned out right. Or I was lucky.
I find myself pretty successful. Better than people I grew up with. There are also folks I know who are doing much better, but someday I will surpass them.

I am not yet sure what my goal in life is, but it must involve a lot of money. I don't care for fame that much.

Sometimes I think I don't have a goal... But I guess that is OK.
