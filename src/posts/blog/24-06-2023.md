A lot has happened in past 6 months.

I've changed job, purchased an apartment, lost more hairs, gained more pounds.

As an individual contributor in my previous job I despised going to office.
As a Technical Manager in my current job, I prefer visiting office as that's the best way I can connect with team.

Before joining the new job I listened to a lot of podcasts on transition from Tech Lead to Manager role, read few books, and although they helped a little, I found myself in a completely new territory.

After 1 month as Technical Manager, I think I am learning the ropes well and enjoying the experience so far.

Manager role is different than an Individual contributor in so many ways I didn't even imagine. Most of my time goes in time management, both mine and team's.

Hoping to improve as Manager in 1 year time while still staying technically competent. 

Signing off for today.
