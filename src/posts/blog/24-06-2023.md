Six months have passed and a lot has happened. I’ve changed jobs, bought an apartment, lost more hair and gained more pounds.

As an individual contributor in my previous job, I despised going to the office. But now as a Technical Manager in my current job, I prefer visiting the office as it’s the best way for me to connect with my team.

Before joining my new job, I listened to many podcasts on transitioning from a Tech Lead to a Manager role and read a few books. Although they helped a little, I found myself in completely new territory.

After one month as Technical Manager, I think I’m learning the ropes well and enjoying the experience so far.

The Manager role is different from an Individual contributor in so many ways that I didn’t even imagine. Most of my time goes into time management, both mine and my team’s. I am also learning to delegate more tasks.

I’m hoping to improve as a Manager in one year’s time while still staying technically competent.

Signing off for today.
