Recently in my hometown, 23rd iteration of yearly interschool sports festival started and it reminded me of my own time when I participated on the 1st iteration 25 years ago.
I was in my school's Basketball team.
We were against the top team in our first match itself. 
We played. We enjoyed.
We lost. We cried. 

This was the first time I participated in a team sport and tasted a defeat.
We lost 2-25.

Next year we played again, and reached semifinals.

I learned 3 lessons from playing:

1. Individual effort doesn't get you far in a team sport.
2. First game isn't your last. Keep playing. Don't quit.
3. Improvement takes time.
