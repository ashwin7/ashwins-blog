A few days ago I found out that a teammate of mine is leaving the company we both work for. I felt bummed. It's not every day you meet self-driven, motivated and talented folks. This reminded me of a conversation I had with an ex-colleague when I was the one leaving my previous organization. He said, we all eventually move on, from jobs, relationships, dreams but that doesn't mean the impact we left is lost. 

I was 12 years old when my parents bought our own house and we moved to it from our rented 1BHK apartment. The little me knew that I'd be leaving all my friends I made up to that point behind. There was no social media back then. For two weeks, every night, me and friends used to sit under the starry sky and talk about whatever 12 year olds talk about before the date of my house-shifting - our hopes and dreams, plans for the future, how we'd never forget each other. There's something special about friendships formed in younger years.

It's crucial to look back to see how far we've come but we still need to keep moving forward. Yes sometimes moving on is painful. Sometimes you have to move on without certain people, but this is also true that if they’re meant to be part of your story, they’ll catch up.
