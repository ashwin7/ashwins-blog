The biting December wind whipped around the Ratlam platform, carrying the metallic tang of train tracks and a prickle of unease down my spine. It was past 10 PM, and my train to Jaipur, a critical escape route back to university and impending semester exams, was nowhere to be seen. Thirty minutes late. Every tick of my watch echoed the mounting panic in my gut.

My father, a man rarely given to displays of affection, stood beside me, his silence as weighty as the worn suitcase clutching my anxieties. It was always this way – strained silences during my visits, punctuated by these unexpected moments of connection at the station. Tonight, we'd dissected politics like surgeons, peeling back layers of opinion with a morbid fascination. And as the train's rumble finally tore through the night, he pulled me into a tight embrace, a tear catching the harsh fluorescent light in his eye.

Relief battled with a gnawing premonition as I clambered aboard. Locating my assigned berth, I found it occupied by a snoring behemoth. Panic spiked. My ticket, clutched like a lifeline, held irrefutable proof – same seat, same train, different month. A moronic typo when booking the ticket, a self-inflicted exile from my own journey. They call me typo_master for nothing.

This wasn't a local milk run; the "Rajdhani Express" devoured distance, carving through the night with only one pit stop - Kota. My mind raced. Talk to the conductor, plead student innocence, hope for leniency.

He arrived, a stern-faced man in a crisp uniform. My explanation stammered out, the ticket evidence damning. A flicker of understanding softened his eyes. No fine, he decreed, but disembark at Kota, buy a new ticket, and endure the purgatory of the general compartment.

Kota station, at 3 AM, wasn't built for lost souls like me. The ticket counter, a cruel joke illuminated by a flickering bulb, mocked my empty wallet. My debit card, a useless talisman in this cash-only purgatory. My carefully planned journey, a meticulously constructed house of cards, lay smoldering at my feet.

Panic morphed into cold terror as I ventured out, swallowed by the inky maze of unfamiliar streets. An hour of fruitless ATM hunting, each empty machine a silent taunt. Lost, directionless, the city's shadows took on menacing forms. And then, the snarls – a pack of feral dogs, their hunger reflected in their glinting eyes.

I did what Usain Bolt might have done on a bad day – run for my life. The station, a beacon of salvation, appeared through a blur of adrenaline and fear. The next Jaipur train, a rickety salvation on four wheels, was about to depart. A miracle, in the form of a friend-of-a-friend, materialized on the platform. A whispered explanation, a borrowed thousand rupees, a desperate dash, and I was crammed into the reeking embrace of the general compartment.

As dawn finally cracked over the Aravalli Hills, painting the sky in shades of hope, I knew one thing for certain – a life lived on the edge of a cashless cliff was a recipe for disaster. It was a hard lesson, etched in fear and a thousand miles of missed connections. And one I vowed never to forget.
