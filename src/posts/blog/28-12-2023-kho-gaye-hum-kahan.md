'Social media makes you feel that you are more connected with people around, but in real, you have never been more lonely than this'. 

Someone shared this quotes on X (previously) twitter with poster of movie 'Kho Gaye Hum Kahan' which prompted me to finally watch the movie.

I had heard decent reviews of the film and it does feel like a movie made with love. I doubt it would've been a commercial success if it was released in a movie theater. 

In the movie, Ahana Singh (Ananya Panday) and Imaad Ali (Siddhant Chaturvedi) are best friends, and also flatmates, or as Imad would jokingly say, they're in a spaceship as they give each other enough space by staying in their respective rooms. Their best friend, the remaining third of this trio, Neil Pereira (Adarsh Gourav) is a gym trainer who aspires to start a chain of fitness centers. 

It is simple, relatable and humble movie that seeps into crevices of your mind and heart in equal amounts. I love the setting and the mood both in emotion and visual. Ananya Panday's on-screen chemistry with Siddhant Chaturvedi is a delight to watch. She crafts a performance that resonates long after the credits roll. Her seamless portrayal adds a touch of magic to the cinematic experience.

By the time movie ends, a genuine connection with the characters is established. We can easily relate to Ahana, Imaad and Neil, as, in all honesty, most of us have experienced those two friends in life with whom we could truly be ourselves.

I believe that a group size of three is ideal when it comes to friendships, whether in reel or real life. Consider iconic films such as "Dil Chahta Hai," "3 Idiots," and "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara," as well as my own life experiences. In school and college, we formed a trio. Over time, we gradually lost touch. Although we occasionally exchange messages on WhatsApp and engage with each other's posts on social media, the dynamics have changed, and we are no longer the same as before.

I still wonder, Kho Gaye Hum Kahan...
